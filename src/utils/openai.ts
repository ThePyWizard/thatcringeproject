Dear potential partner,

Let me introduce you to ${data.name}, a ${data.age}-year-old ${data.relationshipStatus} soul with a heart of gold. With ${data.pastRelationships} relationships worth of experience, they've grown into someone who truly understands the value of authentic connection. Their green flags shine bright: ${data.greenFlags.join(', ')}. When it comes to the perfect date, they dream of ${data.idealDate}. What they seek in a partner is simple yet meaningful: ${data.expectations}.

2. Roasting Version
Attention brave souls! Meet ${data.name}, ${data.age} years young and still ${data.relationshipStatus} (shocking, we know). After ${data.pastRelationships} attempts at love, they've collected enough red flags to start their own parade: ${data.redFlags.join(', ')}. Their idea of a perfect date (${data.idealDate}) is either adorably optimistic or completely delusional - we'll let you decide. But hey, at least they're honest about their expectations: ${data.expectations}. Proceed with caution... or a good sense of humor!`;

  2. A humorous, roasting version that playfully pokes fun at their traits
  
  Details to incorporate:
  - Current status: ${data.relationshipStatus}
  - Relationship experience: ${data.pastRelationships} past relationships
  - Red flags they admit to: ${data.redFlags.join(', ')}
  - Green flags they claim: ${data.greenFlags.join(', ')}
  - What they want in a partner: ${data.expectations}
  - Their idea of a perfect date: ${data.idealDate}
  
  Make the charming version warm and genuine, highlighting their self-awareness and growth.
  Make the roasting version witty and playful without being mean-spirited.
  Include specific references to their provided details in both versions.`;

Based on your ${data.age} years of life experience and ${data.pastRelationships} past relationships, here's what the stars (and your questionable dating history) predict:

Timeline:
- Next month: You'll finally realize that being ${data.relationshipStatus} doesn't mean you have to collect cats
- 3 months: A mysterious stranger will slide into your DMs (it's probably just a bot)
- 6 months: Your perfect match appears... in your dreams
- 1 year: Plot twist - you actually find someone who gets your weird jokes!

Advice:
1. Your dating strategy of waiting for love to find you while Netflix-and-chilling alone isn't working
2. Try leaving your house occasionally - love rarely delivers via UberEats
3. Being ${data.relationshipStatus} is not a personality trait

Remember: Love is like your phone's battery - it dies when you need it most, but there's always a chance to recharge! ðŸ˜‰`;

  Include:
  1. A playful "fortune teller" style introduction
  2. A timeline of future romantic events (both humorous and hopeful)
  3. Three pieces of witty advice
  4. A funny but encouraging conclusion
  
  Make it personal to their situation, age, and experience level.
  Keep the humor light and supportive, not cynical.

Relationship Advice:

2. Communication is key (especially when deciding what's for dinner)
3. Remember: Perfect couples don't exist, but perfect effort does!

Overall: You're like ${compatibilityScore > 75 ? 'peanut butter and jelly' : 'sweet and sour'} - ${
